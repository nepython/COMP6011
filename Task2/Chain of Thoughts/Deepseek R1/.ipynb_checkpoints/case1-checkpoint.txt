Okay, let's tackle this case. The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of recurrent melanoma. She's been on pembrolizumab, which is an immune checkpoint inhibitor, for three years. Now, she has new pulmonary nodules and consolidation on her CT scan.

First, the clinical diagnosis. The key points here are her history of melanoma, treatment with pembrolizumab, and new lung findings. Melanoma can metastasize to the lungs, so that's a possibility. However, she's on immunotherapy, which can cause immune-related adverse effects like pneumonitis. The CT shows consolidation with ground-glass halos, which might suggest an inflammatory process rather than metastases. Also, she's asymptomatic, which is a bit unusual for active infection or aggressive metastases. Other possibilities include infections, especially given her travel history to South America with exposure to fresh water and jungle areas. But the tests for TB and fungal infections (like 1,3-beta-D-glucan) are negative. So, clinical diagnosis is probably between melanoma metastasis and immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis.

For the final diagnosis, they likely did a biopsy. The case mentions that she had a biopsy, maybe of the pulmonary nodules. If the biopsy shows inflammatory cells without malignancy, that would point to pneumonitis. If it shows melanoma cells, then it's metastatic. But considering the context of immunotherapy and the imaging features (ground-glass halos, which can be seen in organizing pneumonia, a type of pneumonitis), the final diagnosis is more likely related to the immunotherapy. Also, she had prior immune-related adverse effects like lichenoid nodules and hypothyroidism, which supports the idea of another immune-related issue. So, the final diagnosis is probably immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis.
