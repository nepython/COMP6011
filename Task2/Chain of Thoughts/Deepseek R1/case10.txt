Okay, let's try to figure out this case. So, the patient is an 11-year-old girl with redness in her eyes that's been going on for 8 weeks. She was treated with antibiotics for possible preseptal cellulitis, but that didn't help. Then she saw an ophthalmologist who found white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and some iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic exam showed optic disk swelling, retinal hemorrhages, and perivascular exudates. They started her on cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops.

Her chest X-ray showed hilar fullness, and CT chest/abdomen revealed diffuse lymphadenopathy. She also had an indeterminate TB test but a positive one six months prior. Now, she's on anti-TB meds and steroids. The MRI showed optic disk enhancement and uveitis but no neuritis. They referred her to rheumatology.

First, the clinical diagnosis. The main symptoms are chronic uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and possible TB history. Uveitis can be infectious or autoimmune. Since she's from West Africa and had a positive TB test, they might suspect TB-related uveitis. But the TB treatment hasn't resolved everything, so maybe it's not just TB. The lymphadenopathy and hilar fullness could point towards sarcoidosis, which can cause uveitis and lymph node enlargement. Sarcoidosis is rare in kids, but possible. Also, the eye findings like keratic precipitates and posterior synechiae are typical of granulomatous uveitis, which is seen in sarcoidosis.

Alternatively, other autoimmune conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) can cause uveitis, but she doesn't have joint symptoms. Beh√ßet's disease could be considered, but she doesn't have oral ulcers or other typical signs. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome presents with uveitis and neurological symptoms, but she doesn't have those either. The negative infectious workup (HIV, syphilis, Lyme) makes infections less likely, except TB, which is still possible but maybe not the whole story.

For the final diagnosis, they might do a biopsy of the lymph nodes to check for granulomas, which would support sarcoidosis. If the biopsy shows non-caseating granulomas, that's classic for sarcoid. Also, ACE levels might be elevated. The response to steroids could also help confirm an autoimmune cause. However, since she's on anti-TB meds and steroids, it might complicate the response. If the lymph node biopsy is positive for TB, then it's TB uveitis, but the initial response to TB treatment wasn't clear. The combination of uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and possible sarcoidosis markers would lead to that final diagnosis.

Wait, but she had an indeterminate TB test recently and a positive one six months ago. She started anti-TB meds, but her current presentation might be sarcoidosis. The hilar lymphadenopathy is a key point. In TB, you might see caseating granulomas, whereas sarcoidosis has non-caseating. Also, TB uveitis is possible, but sarcoidosis can present similarly. The presence of peripheral retinal hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots might be more in line with sarcoid.

So, clinical diagnosis would be something like granulomatous uveitis with systemic involvement, possibly sarcoidosis vs. TB. Final diagnosis after biopsy and further testing would confirm sarcoidosis.
