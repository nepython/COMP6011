Based on the clinical case details provided, the clinical diagnosis and final diagnosis can be determined as follows:

### Clinical Diagnosis

The clinical diagnosis is the initial assessment based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and preliminary test results. In this case, the patient is a 22-year-old man who presented with pain and rapidly spreading erythema of the left hand, along with the development of bullae. The key symptoms and findings include:

*   **Symptoms**: Pain and swelling of the left hand, specifically involving the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. The pain worsened with movement of these fingers, and bullae formed and turned dark purple.
*   **Physical Examination**: The patient had a fever of 38.6Â°C, a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and normal blood pressure and oxygen saturation. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand, and streaking erythema spreading across the hand, forearm, and upper arm into the axilla. The soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible without crepitus, and motor and sensory functions were intact. The hand was warm with a palpable radial pulse and brisk capillary refill.
*   **Medical History**: The patient had no notable medical history and was well before the day of presentation.

Given these findings, the initial clinical diagnosis would likely be a severe skin and soft tissue infection, such as cellulitis with bullae formation. The presence of fever, tachycardia, and streaking erythema suggests an infectious process, possibly with lymphatic involvement (lymphangitis). The bullae indicate a more severe form of cellulitis, often associated with pathogens like group A streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus.

**Clinical Diagnosis**: Bullous cellulitis with lymphangitis

### Final Diagnosis

The final diagnosis is the definitive diagnosis after all diagnostic tests, imaging, biopsies, and specialist consultations have been completed. However, the case provided does not include further diagnostic test results, imaging, or biopsy findings. Therefore, based on the information available, the final diagnosis would still be consistent with the clinical presentation and physical examination findings.

Given the rapid progression of symptoms, the presence of bullae, and the streaking erythema, the most likely diagnosis remains a severe bacterial skin and soft tissue infection, such as bullous cellulitis. In many cases, the final diagnosis would be confirmed by blood cultures, wound cultures, or imaging studies, but since these are not provided, we must rely on the clinical presentation.

**Final Diagnosis**: Bullous cellulitis

In summary:

*   **Clinical Diagnosis**: Bullous cellulitis with lymphangitis
*   **Final Diagnosis**: Bullous cellulitis
