Let's break this down. The clinical diagnosis is based on initial symptoms, history, physical exam, and preliminary tests. The patient had transient vision loss, ptosis, and a mass under the left orbital rim. Labs showed anemia and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging revealed an orbital mass and liver abnormalities.

The final diagnosis comes after all tests and consultations. The patient had an enhancing mass in the left orbit and liver abnormalities with calcifications. Additional tests ruled out infections and vasculitis. The patient's symptoms improved with steroids.

Given the orbital mass, liver abnormalities, and response to steroids, the final diagnosis is likely an inflammatory or autoimmune condition affecting the orbit and liver.

The clinical diagnosis is Orbital Mass with Liver Abnormalities, and the final diagnosis is Orbital Pseudotumor with Hepatic Involvement.
