Alright, the user provided a clinical case with a 29-month-old boy. Given the context, I can make some initial guesses based on symptoms like febrile seizure, waddling gait, low calcium, and high ALP. I’m leaning towards rickets, with hypocalcemia as a key factor.

*   **Clinical Diagnosis**: Nutritional rickets (based on symptoms like waddling gait, eczema, and hypocalcemia).
    
*   **Final Diagnosis**: Rickets (confirmed by lab tests showing low calcium and high ALP levels).

The boy’s history suggests a seizure with hypocalcemia, possibly linked to nephrotic syndrome-related vitamin D deficiency. The labs didn’t show albumin or protein, but the high ALP could reflect rickets.

*   **Initial Diagnosis:** Nutritional rickets, potentially due to nephrotic syndrome.
    
*   **Final Diagnosis:** Vitamin D deficiency caused by urinary loss of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, commonly seen in nephrotic syndrome. Alternatively, it could be related to Fanconi syndrome, but there's no evidence of phosphaturia or glycosuria.
    

It looks like the situation involves a combination of factors: the child has primary membranous nephropathy, leading to proteinuria and loss of vitamin D, which could explain the hypocalcemia and rickets. Immunosuppressant treatments (like cyclophosphamide) might have further exacerbated this situation. There's also a potential for infections due to the immunosuppression. The main question should be whether the proteinuria persisted after these treatments. These pieces of the puzzle might help narrow down the diagnosis.

The boy could have had a seizure due to hypocalcemia related to vitamin D deficiency from nephrotic syndrome. However, initial labs didn’t show albumin or protein, but high ALP could indicate rickets. While vitamin D deficiency seems likely, we have to confirm the cause. The final diagnosis might be vitamin D deficiency due to urinary loss in nephrotic syndrome, though Fanconi syndrome is also possible, but without evidence of phosphaturia. Biopsy and specialist consults will help confirm.

For this metabolic case, it seems the final diagnosis will depend on lab and genetic tests. The clinical diagnosis is likely hypocalcemic seizure due to rickets. Considering the boy’s primary membranous nephropathy, immunosuppressive therapy, diet, and proteinuria, the final diagnosis might be nutritional vitamin D deficiency rickets. The labs could show low 25-hydroxyvitamin D and high PTH, with genetic testing for vitamin D receptor mutations. I’ll check the article for biochemical test details and radiographs of the wrists.
