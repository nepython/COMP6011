The initial diagnosis might lean toward community-acquired pneumonia, COVID-19, or pulmonary hemorrhage. But with hemoglobin at 6.7, there’s severe anemia — which, combined with RBC casts in the urine, points to possible renal involvement. It could be Goodpasture’s syndrome, explaining both the pulmonary hemorrhage (hemoptysis, ground-glass opacities) and glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria). The clinical diagnosis might be diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, with suspicion of anti-

The initial diagnosis might lean toward community-acquired pneumonia, COVID-19, or pulmonary hemorrhage. But with hemoglobin at 6.7, there’s severe anemia — which, combined with RBC casts in the urine, points to possible renal involvement. It could be Goodpasture’s syndrome, explaining both the pulmonary hemorrhage (hemoptysis, ground-glass opacities) and glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria). The clinical diagnosis might be diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, with suspicion of anti-GBM disease, though it's still early, and pneumonia can't be ruled out.

With a hemoglobin of 6.7 and RBC casts, the situation likely points to pulmonary hemorrhage associated with glomerulonephritis, potentially from Goodpasture’s syndrome (anti-GBM disease). The clinical diagnosis could be diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, while the final diagnosis would likely be anti-GBM disease. Given initial pneumonia treatment, the diagnosis might have been community-acquired pneumonia before recognizing the hemorrhage. I'll confirm details and gather citations, particularly focusing on Goodpasture’s syndrome and the process of confirming anti-GBM disease.
