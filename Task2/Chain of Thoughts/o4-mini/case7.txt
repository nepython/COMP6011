The case seems to point towards several potential diagnoses: Kawasaki disease, Crohn's disease, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease. The 14-year-old has fatigue, fever, joint pain, and GI symptoms, which make things tricky. The symptoms started after camp, with a tick exposure throwing in a wrinkle. His antibiotic treatment for suspected sinusitis and a mild response to amoxicillin complicate the picture too, adding considerations for infection-related issues. A more thorough exam and testing are needed to narrow this down.

The initial clinical diagnosis appears to point at a tick-borne infection, possibly Lyme disease, given the patient's history and the decision to start doxycycline. There's also the possibility of reactive arthritis or bacterial enteritis like Yersinia, which might explain abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Lab work supports an inflammatory process, but imaging didn't show significant changes. While sinusitis was initially considered, the decision to treat empirically for a tick-borne illness seems most aligned with the clinical picture.

Okay, the initial clinical diagnosis seems to be “suspected Lyme disease” based on the patient's symptoms (tick exposure and joint pain). Could also consider a potential tick-borne illness or septic arthritis, though the latter doesn’t fit as well because there’s no joint swelling. After further testing, the final diagnosis could lean toward inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn's, especially with the combination of symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, and extraintestinal manifestations such as arthritis. However, they still need a colonoscopy to confirm this.

The rising lipase levels point towards the potential for pancreatitis, which could be related to IBD, but other signs like GI symptoms and positive fecal occult blood suggest mucosal inflammation, which is more consistent with Crohn's disease. The patient’s prolonged fever, malaise, and diarrhea, along with joint pain, also fit with IBD. The next step would likely involve endoscopy and biopsy to confirm Crohn's disease, especially since this could be a published case in NEJM that I should check.

I’m weighing whether this could be a case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which can happen after viral infections, like viral gastroenteritis. MIS-C typically features fever, GI symptoms, joint pain, and elevated inflammatory markers. However, it usually involves a rash, conjunctivitis, and possibly shock, which aren't present here. There wasn't mention of COVID either, though MIS-C can occur 2-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, so I’ll need to check if the case was discussed in an NEJM record.

I’m considering the final diagnosis could be Yersinia enterocolitica or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection. Yersinia enterocolitica is common in the U.S. and can cause fever, joint pain, GI symptoms, and mesenteric lymphadenitis, especially in children. The patient has arthralgia and GI symptoms but was treated with doxycycline, which doesn’t target Yersinia. The stool culture was positive for Yersinia. Another possibility is systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), but there's no rash and the pancreatitis doesn’t align with Yersinia.

I'm considering various diagnoses: systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), but the patient doesn't have all the symptoms, like rash or serositis. Acute pancreatitis from systemic JIA seems unlikely too. Then there's MIS-C, but the patient doesn't have the key features, like COVID history or rash. Acute rheumatic fever and other juvenile arthritis types don't align well either. My next step is to search for case records, possibly from NEJM, to refine this diagnosis.

I'm exploring different diagnoses: SJIA, but the symptoms don't quite match, such as no rash or serositis. Acute pancreatitis seems unlikely with systemic JIA. MIS-C is possible but requires past COVID exposure, which wasn't mentioned. Acute rheumatic fever doesn't fit either. I think we need more tests, imaging, and specialist opinions to confirm a final diagnosis. I'll check for any NEJM case summaries or blog insights that could help clarify the case.

The clinical diagnosis likely revolves around "Yersinia pseudotuberculosis," given the symptoms of mesenteric adenitis, fever, diarrhea, and joint pain. While the patient had camping exposure and was started on doxycycline for a suspected tick-borne illness, the symptoms didn't resolve. While other diagnoses were considered (like Lyme or Ehrlichia), they didn’t fit all the clinical signs. Yersinia enterocolitica could also be the cause, with symptoms presenting similarly but with the possibility of reactive arthritis appearing later, around 1-4 weeks post-infection.

The patient's joint pain alongside GI symptoms is typical of Yersinia infections, where arthralgia often occurs simultaneously. Given the patient’s asymmetric arthritis affecting the right shoulder and left knee, reactive arthritis (which can develop post-infection) seems likely. So, the final diagnosis might be "Yersinia enterocolitica infection." This would be confirmed after stool culture and consultation with GI/infectious disease specialists. Although the search didn’t yield a summary, the diagnosis is supported by clinical reasoning.

This case is pointing towards a more unusual diagnosis like Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, especially given the exposure history (e.g., summer camp, ticks, rural New England). While many common GI conditions are considered, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis stands out due to its potential for causing fever, abdominal cramps, and arthritis. The presence of positive fecal occult blood further suggests colonic mucosal inflammation, which is consistent with this infection. Multiple differentials can’t be ruled out yet, but this seems like a promising lead for the final diagnosis.

Okay, so I found that at line 64, they confirm the final diagnosis as Crohn's disease: "niño de 14 años con un nuevo diagnóstico de enfermedad de Crohn..." This seems to be the medical conclusion after a colonoscopy and further biopsy confirmation. Before this was mentioned, there was a possible consideration of Lyme disease or a tick-borne infection, with doxycycline administered. It looks like Crohn's disease was finally confirmed with biopsy, so the ultimate diagnosis is indeed Crohn's.

It seems Dr. Zanger's differential lists Lyme disease as the second possibility, but they don't declare it as the initial diagnosis. They just started empirical doxycycline, implying a clinical diagnosis of suspected tick-borne illness (likely Lyme). Initially, they suspected viral syndrome, but after reviewing symptoms and history (tick exposure, fever, arthralgia), Lyme disease appears to be their working presumption. So, to be clear, the initial diagnosis was likely suspected Lyme disease, based on clinical symptoms and history, and treated with doxycycline.

In the case record, it's clear that doxycycline was started empirically, suggesting initial suspicion of a tick-borne illness — possibly Lyme disease. While they didn't explicitly state "Lyme disease," the treatment for potential tick exposure strongly implies that. The citation can come from the case itself: "Intravenous fluids were administered, and empirical treatment with doxycycline was started," which points to the clinical decision. I'll reference this directly, perhaps along with a source from the Spanish blog as confirmation in relation to Lyme disease transmission.

The case mentions that "intravenous fluids were administered, and empirical treatment with doxycycline was started." Since this is user-provided data, we don't need to cite it. For factual statements or external information, citations are needed, but we can draw from the user's text without citation. Therefore, we can state the clinical diagnosis of suspected Lyme disease based on empiric doxycycline therapy, but a citation might be required if we include information about doxycycline and Lyme disease from external sources.

The clinical diagnosis of suspected tick-borne infection seems reasonable. However, for the final diagnosis of Crohn's disease, I’ll need to cite a web source to support it. There’s a statement in a Spanish blog about a new diagnosis of Crohn's disease ("nuevo diagnóstico de enfermedad de Crohn") that could be used as a citation, but ideally, an English source would be preferred. However, since instructions call for web sources, referencing the Spanish blog is fine for this.
