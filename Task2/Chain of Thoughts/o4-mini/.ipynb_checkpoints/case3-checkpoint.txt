The presented symptoms suggest viral encephalitis, given fever, headache, confusion, and CSF abnormalities. However, the MRI findings with leptomeningeal enhancement and restricted diffusion point toward a primary CNS lymphoma, specifically primary vitreoretinal lymphoma. It's likely that the final diagnosis is primary CNS lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). I’ll consult "Case 32-2020 NEJM" to better understand this case and refine the diagnosis. I'll also search for "NEJM Case 32-2020 primary CNS lymphoma" to gather more details.

I’m leaning toward a diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma based on the case details. The association with membranous nephropathy and lymphoma, along with neurological signs, suggested intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, though the ocular findings seem to point to ocular lymphoma. They didn’t mention a biopsy, so it’s possible they proceeded with medication like methylprednisolone or other testing. I still wonder if autoimmune factors play a role, but primary CNS lymphoma seems most likely for now.

The clinical diagnosis was initially viral encephalitis, but the final diagnosis seems to be Primary CNS lymphoma, likely Diffuse large B-cell type due to ocular and CNS involvement. The ocular findings suggest primary intraocular lymphoma, but since there are leptomeningeal and pons lesions, it aligns with primary CNS lymphoma. I’ll search for more information on NEJM, but it looks like the formal diagnosis would be Primary CNS lymphoma, with lymphoma being more likely than encephalitis.

The patient is immunocompromised, which raises suspicion for opportunistic infections, but tests for infections like HIV, VZV, and CMV came back negative. MRI findings point to possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but there’s also pleocytosis, suggesting inflammation. Considering ocular involvement and immunosuppression, primary vitreoretinal lymphoma stands out. The final diagnosis points to primary CNS lymphoma (B-cell lymphoma), confirmed by the vitreous biopsy showing B-cell lymphoma cells. There's a strong case for lymphoma, given the clinical clues and biopsy results.

The most likely final diagnosis is Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), specifically Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The initial clinical diagnosis seemed like viral encephalitis, but given the symptoms and findings, it could also point to meningoencephalitis or meningitis. I’ll reference sources that describe viral encephalitis as a differential diagnosis, particularly for symptoms like lymphocytic pleocytosis, fever, and speech issues. For the final diagnosis, I’ll cite sources discussing primary CNS lymphoma, especially considering the clinical course so far.
