The case involves a 57-year-old man with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), recently immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and prednisone. Heâ€™s presenting fever, weight loss, and a persistent cough. Chest imaging reveals centrilobular emphysema, small pulmonary nodules, and bronchial wall thickening. Despite antibiotic therapy and treatment for C. albicans and PCP, symptoms are ongoing. The likely diagnosis appears to be an infectious complication or pulmonary involvement related to immunosuppression, although a final diagnosis needs more analysis or specific tests.

The case presents a patient with persistent pneumonia or refractory pneumonia due to immunosuppression, initially suspected to be mycobacterial or atypical pneumonia. However, further testing, including a positive galactomannan result, pointed toward invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The imaging and BAL findings were consistent with Aspergillus infection, particularly given the immunocompromised state. The final diagnosis is chronic invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, with subacute features, and treatment with voriconazole was started. Initial misdiagnosis likely stemmed from the complex clinical progression and immunosuppression factors.
