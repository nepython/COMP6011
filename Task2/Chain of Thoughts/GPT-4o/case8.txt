The case involves a 57-year-old man with persistent cough and pulmonary opacities. His medical history includes polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), treated with cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and methotrexate. A CT scan showed centrilobular emphysema, pulmonary nodules, and bronchial wall thickening. He recently experienced fevers and productive green sputum.

The preliminary diagnosis includes potential respiratory or infectious complications related to his autoimmune treatment. The final diagnosis may involve an infection or worsening lung condition, possibly associated with his PAN or treatment history.

The patient has a complicated respiratory history, including recurring infections, Candida growth in sputum, patchy opacities on CXR, and persistent symptoms such as cough, fever, and dyspnea. He received multiple treatments, including antibiotics, prednisone, and bronchoscopy, with varying levels of improvement. Six weeks later, symptoms recurred, marked by new findings on imaging (e.g. centrilobular nodules and lymphadenopathy). Bal galactomannan positivity suggests potential fungal involvement, possibly aspergillosis, following discharge. The patient remains hospitalized with ongoing respiratory issues.

The patient has a complex medical history, including polyarteritis nodosa, diabetes, pancreatitis, and hypertension. They are on several medications, including prednisone and methotrexate. Weight loss is noted, and they have a history of smoking. On readmission, vital signs show mild hypoxia with SpO2 of 91%, alongside signs of respiratory distress like tachypnea and wheezing. Imaging reveals worsening bilateral diffuse opacities and patchy lesions. Cultures from previous tests showed Candida species and enterococcus, without mycobacteria.

Case 15-2022 BAL galactomannan positive final diagnosis NEJM

The imaging findings continued to worsen despite antibiotic treatment, suggesting a final diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This could also be classified as chronic or semi-invasive aspergillosis, especially in an immunosuppressed individual, which likely refers to Aspergillus fumigatus. The clinical diagnosis originally pointed to bacterial pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia. To confirm, I would need to find accurate, up-to-date information, possibly from journals like NEJM, regarding cases similar to this one for confirmation of the final diagnosis.

The patient received empiric IV voriconazole, and methotrexate was interrupted. Initial findings suggested multifocal pulmonary opacities despite antibiotics, raising concerns about possible infection or autoimmune involvement (e.g., PAN). Repeat imaging highlighted centrilobular nodules and consolidation. The galactomannan test was positive, pointing toward invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, likely worsened by immunosuppressive treatments. A suspected clinical diagnosis might include bronchiolitis obliterans or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, though persistent symptoms suggest further investigation is needed to clarify the primary etiology.

Based on the initial imaging and labs, the "tree-in-bud" CT pattern points toward infectious bronchiolitis, possibly an atypical mycobacterial infection. The early working diagnosis likely centered on recurrent pneumonia or bacterial bronchopneumonia, given the patient's immunocompromised status. Initial treatment included vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. Despite initial treatments, further testing with BAL galactomannan confirmed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, which showed improvement on voriconazole. Thus, the final diagnosis shifted once further evidence emerged.

A "tree-in-bud" pattern can indicate infectious bronchiolitis, mycobacterial, or viral infections, but the initial suspicion points to bacterial pneumonia, especially given the productive cough and green sputum. This could fit a typical presentation for bacterial pneumonia cases, though the other possibilities should still be considered depending on further tests. It's important to decide if additional investigations are needed to rule out other causes like viral or tuberculosis pneumonia.
