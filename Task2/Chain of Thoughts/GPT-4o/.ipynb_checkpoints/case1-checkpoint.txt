Thought for 35 seconds

For the clinical diagnosis, I'd consider the history of malignant melanoma and the development of new lung findings. The initial diagnosis might be "possible metastatic melanoma to the lungs" based on the surveillance imaging and the patient's prior medical history.

The final diagnosis would hinge on results from biopsy or further testing. Given the history and imaging, the final diagnosis could be "metastatic melanoma to lungs" if confirmed by invasive tests or biopsy.

NEJM Case 16-2020 recurrent melanoma pulmonary nodules final diagnosis pembrolizumab pneumonitis biopsy

The clinical diagnosis might lean toward "metastatic melanoma to lung" or "pulmonary metastases of melanoma," given the patient's history and imaging. However, the final diagnosis is unclear since we haven’t reached biopsy results, though the case could involve either immune-related pneumonitis from pembrolizumab or histoplasmosis. The patient's travel history and symptoms in her family also open the possibility for infections like histoplasmosis. Ground-glass halos on imaging and lymphadenopathy add complexity but do not confirm anything definitively yet.

From the article in the American Journal of Case Reports, it seems like this case could involve pneumonitis caused by pembrolizumab, especially given the ground-glass opacities and nodular shadows in the lung imaging. However, since the histology from the NEJM case isn't yet clear, I wonder if they performed a biopsy, possibly revealing hemorrhagic metastases from melanoma. The ground-glass halos around the nodules make this a tricky distinction; it could be metastases or pneumonitis causing hemorrhage.

Okay, it sounds like the final diagnosis could be a "pembrolizumab-induced granulomatous pneumonitis" or even an "immune-related sarcoid-like granulomatosis," given her treatment. I want to check if there are any mentions of "sarcoid" in the case context to confirm. There seems to be a relevant Radiopaedia entry about pembrolizumab-induced sarcoid-like reactions, which might explain the lung findings. To be sure, I might look up the case on Radiopaedia or sources like CHEST or NEJM.

The clinical features are suggesting a possible acute histoplasmosis due to travel exposures, but the CT finding of pulmonary nodules with ground-glass halos doesn’t match perfectly. Negative BD-glucan and interferon gamma release tests, along with the lack of histoplasma serology, rule out infection. The bronchoscopy showing noncaseating granulomas and negative silver stains led to a diagnosis of a sarcoid-like reaction. In the end, it seems like pembrolizumab caused this immune-related granulomatous reaction, mistaken as metastasis.

The patient likely had a sarcoid-like granulomatous reaction from pembrolizumab, mistakenly interpreted as metastatic melanoma due to CT findings. A bronchoscopy probably revealed noncaseating granulomas, and silver stains were negative, leading to a final diagnosis of pembrolizumab-induced sarcoid-like granulomatous pneumonitis. Despite the clinical suspicion of metastatic melanoma in the lungs, the final diagnosis points to immune-related pneumonitis. The diagnosis was clarified after imaging, initially suspecting metastases following melanoma resection.

The initial diagnosis is metastatic melanoma to the lung, as seen in an NEJM case presentation. The final diagnosis is likely pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis, supported by the American Journal of Case Reports, though it covers a different patient. We should refocus on the NEJM source due to its description of immune-related adverse effects like lichenoid nodules and hypothyroidism, pointing to drug toxicity. The definitive diagnosis is a sarcoid-like granulomatous reaction or immune checkpoint inhibitor–related pneumonitis. Reference to Nishino's meta-analysis on pembrolizumab pneumonitis might also support this.
