The case involves a 14-year-old boy with fever, joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Symptoms began with fatigue and fever, followed by a sore throat and a possible viral infection diagnosis. The child developed joint pain, with elevated WBC and ESR, and Lyme disease testing was done. On admission, he presented with bilateral shoulder and knee pain, chills, night sweats, headache, myalgias, and gastrointestinal issues. No weight loss or rash noted. History includes autism, asthma, rhinosinusitis, and allergies. Further clarification is needed for a final diagnosis.

The 14-year-old boy presents with fever, joint pain, GI symptoms, and aphthous ulcers. He has tick exposure, which suggests potential Lyme disease, but the GI symptoms and aphthous ulcers also raise concerns about inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, which can present with arthritis. The differential includes juvenile idiopathic arthritis, reactive arthritis post-GI infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, and salmonella. Considering his symptoms, IBD-associated arthritis, specifically enteropathic arthritis, may be a strong consideration.

The presentation suggests multiple possibilities: reactive arthritis, acute pancreatitis, or Crohn's disease with enteropathic arthritis. The lack of significant weight loss makes Crohn's less likely, though there are signs of inflammatory bowel disease. There’s also juvenile idiopathic arthritis (systemic), but it’s not a perfect match. Elevated lipase and GI symptoms could be related to serositis. Given these factors, the initial diagnosis seems to point toward reactive arthritis or viral arthralgia, but further analysis is needed.

The boy's symptoms, including GI infection, watery diarrhea, and arthralgia, suggest several possibilities. Reactive arthritis could be considered, but it’s often linked with HLA-B27 and enthesitis. Aphthous ulcers don't align with that, but might point to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like Crohn's disease, which can also cause arthritis and GI issues. While acute pancreatitis might come to mind due to elevated lipase, the mild elevation doesn’t fit perfectly. Weight loss is also absent, which makes IBD less likely. However, testing is needed for confirmation.

I’m now wondering if the diagnosis could be juvenile idiopathic arthritis, particularly systemic onset (SoJIA), which can present with fevers, rash, and high ferritin, along with joint issues. But GI symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea aren’t as common there. Alternatively, it might be an infectious cause, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, or even reactive arthritis, though it usually follows a GI infection 1-4 weeks later. But the ongoing diarrhea complicates that theory. I’ll look up NEJM Case 3-2022 for more details.

reactive arthritis after diarrhea joint pain pediatric features

With this 14-year-old's symptoms — joint pain, GI issues, abdominal cramping, and even elevated lipase — I’m thinking about a few possibilities. The combination of GI and arthritis makes inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) likely, especially since Crohn's disease can present like this. Other options like reactive arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or even a viral infection are nearby contenders. His lab work and history make me lean toward IBD, but the dynamics are still complex. Let’s focus on finding a reliable source or summary to confirm this case’s definitive diagnosis.
