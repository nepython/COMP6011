Here's my thinking process to arrive at the clinical and final diagnoses for Case 33-2022:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Identify the concise clinical diagnosis (based on initial presentation and tests) and the concise final diagnosis (based on definitive tests, if available in the text) for an 11-year-old girl with eye redness.
    
2.  **Analyze the Case for Clinical Diagnosis:** Break down the provided text for initial clues:
    
    *   **Patient Profile:** 11-year-old girl, emigrated from West Africa 6 years prior, lives in New England. History of positive TB test (IGRA) 6 months ago, prescribed latent TB treatment but unclear if taken. Generally well until 8 weeks ago.
    *   **Presenting Symptoms (8 weeks prior):** Bilateral eye redness (worse right), intermittent eyelid swelling. _No_ photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge initially. Persisted despite eye drops and oral antibiotics (for possible preseptal cellulitis).
    *   **Ophthalmology Exam (5 weeks prior):** Visual acuity 20/20 R, 20/25 L. Slit-lamp: Abundant white cells in anterior chamber (uveitis), keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae (R), rare iris nodules (R). Funduscopy: Optic disk swelling (papilledema), peripheral retinal hemorrhages (bilateral), perivascular exudates (R). Diagnosis here is clearly **uveitis** (specifically panuveitis given anterior chamber, vitreous, retinal, and optic nerve involvement).
    *   **Systemic Workup (initiated 5 weeks prior):**
        *   Infectious screening: HIV, Syphilis, Lyme negative. TB IGRA _indeterminate_.
        *   Chest X-ray: Hilar fullness.
        *   Chest/Abdomen CT: Diffuse lymphadenopathy (mediastinal, upper abdominal, axillary). Normal thymus.
    *   **Emergency Dept Visit (2 weeks prior, for expedited workup):** Eye redness persisted but lessened. _No_ fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain reported. Exam: Afebrile, BP normal, appears well. Eye exam confirmed findings: anterior chamber cells, keratic precipitates, synechiae (R), vitreous cells, optic disk swelling, perivascular exudates, retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots (bilateral).
    *   **Further Hospital Workup:** Methylprednisolone given. Sputum for AFB smear/culture obtained (results not given). OCT: Optic disk swelling. Fluorescein Angiography: Optic disk leakage, peripheral retinal nonperfusion, vessel leakage. MRI Head: Optic disk protrusion/enhancement, iris enhancement (consistent with uveitis). _No_ optic neuritis.
    *   **Treatment Initiated:** Prednisolone eye drops, Cyclopentolate eye drops, oral prednisone (for inflammation/uveitis), and _empirical_ RIPE therapy (Rifampin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol) started for _possible tuberculosis_.
    *   **Rheumatology Clinic (current evaluation):** Confirmed history of positive IGRA 6 months prior, uncertain latent TB treatment. Currently on eye drops, oral steroids, and RIPE therapy.
3.  **Synthesize for Clinical Diagnosis:**
    
    *   The core clinical finding is severe bilateral **uveitis** (panuveitis).
        
    *   Systemic findings include **hilar fullness** on CXR and **diffuse lymphadenopathy** on CT.
        
    *   The patient emigrated from a TB-endemic region (West Africa).
        
    *   There's a history of a **positive TB IGRA** 6 months prior, with uncertain treatment for latent TB.
        
    *   Although the current IGRA was indeterminate, the combination of severe uveitis, hilar/diffuse lymphadenopathy, origin from an endemic area, and prior positive TB test strongly points towards tuberculosis as the underlying cause, even before definitive proof. Sarcoidosis could be a differential (causes uveitis and lymphadenopathy), but given the specific TB history, TB is much higher on the list.
        
    *   The clinicians started empirical anti-TB treatment, reflecting this strong suspicion.
        
    *   _Formulating the Clinical Diagnosis:_ The diagnosis based on the initial comprehensive workup (before definitive proof like culture or biopsy) is **Tuberculous uveitis** (or Ocular Tuberculosis) with associated lymphadenopathy. Given the strong suspicion and initiation of empirical treatment, this fits the clinical diagnosis stage.
        
4.  **Analyze the Case for Final Diagnosis:**
    
    *   The case description details the clinical presentation, extensive initial investigations (imaging, ophthalmology exams, labs), and the _initiation_ of empirical anti-TB treatment and steroids.
    *   It mentions sputum cultures were obtained, but the results are _not_ provided in the text.
    *   There is no mention of lymph node biopsy results or response to treatment that would definitively confirm tuberculosis as the cause.
    *   The diagnosis relies heavily on the constellation of findings (uveitis, lymphadenopathy, origin, prior positive IGRA) and the empirical treatment decision. While highly likely, it hasn't reached the "final, definitive" stage _within the provided narrative_.
5.  **Synthesize for Final Diagnosis:**
    
    *   Similar to the previous case, the text describes the workup and _initiation_ of treatment based on a strong clinical suspicion, but it does not provide the results of definitive tests (like positive M. tuberculosis culture from sputum or lymph node biopsy) or long-term response to treatment that would confirm the diagnosis.
    *   Therefore, based _strictly_ on the given text, the final diagnosis is **Not provided in the text**.
6.  **Refine the Output:** Request requires very few words.
    
    *   Clinical Diagnosis: **Tuberculous uveitis** (or Ocular tuberculosis)
    *   Final Diagnosis: **Not provided in the text**
